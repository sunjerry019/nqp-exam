[Question Paper](/exercise.pdf)   
[Final Report](/final_report.pdf)

Please note that there was a mistake in the energy spectrum plotted in the final report for the Hamiltonian in the operator basis (page 7 of the report) due to an error in the code that builds the Hamiltonian matrix. The code has since been updated, but the report was kept asis since that was the final version that was submitted.
